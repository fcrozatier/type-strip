# The Type Strip

*A type-stripper keeping your code forward compatible with the TC39 Type Annotation Proposal*

`TypeStrip` is a lightweight TypeScript type-stripper: it takes TypeScript code as input and outputs JavaScript code with the type annotations removed.

The main goal of this project is to also ensure **forward compatibility** of your code with the TC39 [Type Annotation Proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-type-annotations/). This means that when the proposal reaches stage 4, you'll be able to transition your code seamlessly by just changing the file extensions to `.js`, and you won't need a transpilation step anymore.

## Features

- Strips type annotations. If you're using modern TypeScript, then this may be all the transpilation you need
- Throws an error when an [unsupported syntax](#unsupported-syntaxes) is detected.
- Performs automatic semi-column insertion.

## How to Use?

### Install

```sh
# deno
deno add jsr:@fcrozatier/type-strip

# npm (one of the below, depending on your package manager)
npx jsr add @fcrozatier/type-strip
yarn dlx jsr add @fcrozatier/type-strip
pnpm dlx jsr add @fcrozatier/type-strip
bunx jsr add @fcrozatier/type-strip
```



<h2 id="unsupported-syntaxes">Unsupported syntaxes</h2>

The goal of the TC39 [proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-type-annotations/) is to add type annotations without modifying the semantics of the language. This means that TypeScript-only features requiring a transpilation step are not supported.

### Auto-Accessors in Classes

[Auto-Accessors](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#auto-accessors-in-classes) are not yet natively supported in JavaScript and are part of the stage 3 <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators#class-auto-accessors">Decorator proposal</a>

```ts
class Person {
    accessor name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```
An alternative is to use explicit getters/setters

```ts
class Person {
  #name: string;
  get name() {
    return this.#name;
  }
  set name(value: string) {
    this.#name = value;
  }
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

### Ambient Declarations

Ambient Declarations are still up for discussion in the TC39 type annotation proposal. At the moment the proposal doesn't reserve space for ambient declarations.

```ts
declare const foo: Bar
```
If you only need them for type-checking, the alternative is to expose them in a separate file.

### Decorators

[Decorators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators) are not yet natively supported in JavaScript, and are part of the stage 3 [Decorator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators)

```ts
@Logger("debug")
class Custom extends HTMLElement {
  //...
}
```
If you rely on them you can still have a transpilation step beforehand. Another alternative is to use the [mixin pattern](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html)

```ts
export const Flying = <T extends new (...args: any[]) => any>(
  superclass: T,
) => {
  return class extends superclass {
    constructor(...options: any[]) {
      console.log("initializing...");
      super(...options);
    }
    fly() {
      console.log("flying!");
    }
  };
};

class Dog {}
class FlyingDog extends Flying(Dog) {}
const flyingDog = new FlyingDog(); //-> initializing...
flyingDog.fly(); //-> flying!
```
### Enums

[Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) are a TypeScript feature that requires transpilation and has runtime semantics. There is a recent stage 0 [proposal](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-enum) to include them in the language.

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}
```

An alternative is to use a `const` object

```ts
const Direction = {
  Up: "UP",
  Down: "DOWN",
  Left: "LEFT",
  Right: "RIGHT",
} as const

type Direction = keyof typeof Direction;
```

### JSX

JSX is not intended to be implemented by browsers, but to be used by preprocessors. It's not part of the TC39 proposal.

### Namespace

[Namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html) are a legacy TypeScript-specific construct to provide modularity and encapsulation. They are not supported by the TC39 type annotation proposal. Standard ES modules are the preferred way to address these needs

### Overloads

[Function overloads](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#function-overloads) are still up for discussion in the TC39 type annotation proposal. At the moment the proposal doesn't reserve space for function overloads.

```ts
/**
 * Returns an array of numbers between 0 and `stop` (excluded) in increments of 1
 */
export function range(stop: number): number[];
/**
 * Returns an array of numbers between `start` and `stop` (excluded) in increments of 1
 */
export function range(start: number, stop: number): number[];
/**
 * Returns an array of numbers between `start` and `stop` (excluded) in increments of `step`
 */
export function range(start: number, stop: number, step: number): number[];
export function range(startOrStop: number, stop?: number, step?: number) {
	let start = startOrStop;
	if (stop !== undefined && step !== undefined) {
		return Array.from(
			{ length: (stop - start) / step },
			(_, i) => start + i * step,
		);
	} else if (stop !== undefined) {
		return Array.from({ length: stop - start }, (_, i) => start + i);
	} else {
		const stop = startOrStop;
		start = 0;
		return Array.from({ length: stop - start }, (_, i) => start + i);
	}
}
```

An alternative is to branch depending on the number of arguments or their type

```ts
type RangeOptions =
	| [stop: number]
	| [start: number, stop: number]
	| [start: number, stop: number, step: number];

/**
 * Makes an array of numbers between `start` (defaults to 0) and `stop` (excluded) in increments of `step` (defaults to 1)
 */
export function range(...args: RangeOptions) {
  switch (args.length) {
    case 1: {
      const [stop] = args;
      return Array.from({ length: stop }, (_, i) => i);
    }
    case 2: {
      const [start, stop] = args;
      return Array.from({ length: stop - start }, (_, i) => start + i);
    }
    case 3: {
      const [start, stop, step] = args;
      return Array.from(
        { length: (stop - start) / step },
        (_, i) => start + i * step,
      );
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameter Properties

[Parameter Properties](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#parameter-properties) are a convenience TypeScript syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property, but do not align with existing Javascript semantics. They are not supported by the TC39 type annotation proposal.

```ts
class Params {
  constructor(
    public readonly x: number,
    protected y: number,
    private z: number
  ) {
    // No body necessary
  }
}
```
The alternative is to use explicit field declarations and assignments
```ts
class Params {
  public readonly x: number,
  protected y: number,
  private z: number

  constructor(x: number, y: number, z: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.z = z;
  }
}
```

### Prefix-style type assertion

This is a legacy TypeScript syntax, the preferred way to assert a type is to use an `as`-expression

```ts
const something: unknown = "this is a string";
const legacy = (<string>something).length; // legacy prefix-style
const modern = (something as string).length; // as-expression
```
