    "Enums have runtime semantics and are not supported by the TC39 type annotation proposal. An alternative pattern is to use a const object",

    "Namespaces are a legacy TypeScript specific construct to provide modularity and an encapsulation. They are not supported by the TC39 type annotation proposal. Standard ES modules are the preferred way to address these needs",

    "Parameter Properties are a convenience TypeScript syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property, but do not align with existing Javascript semantics. They are not supported by the TC39 type annotation proposal. The alternative is to use explicit field declarations and assignments",
